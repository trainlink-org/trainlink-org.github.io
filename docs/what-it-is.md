# What is TrainLink?

TrainLink is a brand new technology that allows throttles and other software to communicate with DCC controllers over a WiFi or LAN. This is designed to give users maximum flexibility over how they use their model railways.

There are two main parts to TrainLink, TrainLink Command and TrainLink Connect.

TrainLink is fully open source under the GNU GPL v3 license. What this means is you can use the provided TrainLink code for anything you want, including commercial use, as long as you use the same license (GNU GPL v3). This license has been chosen as it encourages developers to contribute back to the open source community.

## TrainLink Command

[TrainLink Command](https://trainlink-org.github.io/trainlink-command) is our first party throttle that uses the TrainLink Connect technology.
It is available as an app on Linux or Windows and as a web app for any modern platform.

## TrainLink Connect

[TrainLink Connect](https://trainlink-org.github.io/trainlink-connect) is the underlying technology that powers TrainLink Command.
It is a fully open source protocol, meaning anyone can write an app that can talk to other TrainLink Connect throttles and servers.

## What hardware is supported?

Currently, TrainLink Command supports DCC-EX's [CommandStation EX](https://dcc-ex.com/ex-commandstation/index.html).
However, the underlying technology is hardware agnostic meaning it is possible to add support for more hardware.

If you would like to see your hardware supported, then [let us know](./support.md)!
