# Developing with TrainLink

Thank you for wanting to contribute to TrainLink! This page will take you over how to get started, whether you want to make your own app work with TrainLink or contribute to TrainLink itself.

## Using TrainLink

If you want to use TrainLink in your own app or project, the best place to start will be the [TrainLink Connect documentation](https://trainlink-org.github.io/trainlink-connect).
There you can find details on how the protocol works and some libraries that may help if you are working in TypeScript or JavaScript.

If you build something with TrainLink, let us know! We'd love to feature it here on our website. In return, please notify your users that your app uses TrainLink Connect and point them here.

## Contributing to TrainLink

To work on any part of TrainLink, you are first going to need a GitHub account if you want to submit your contributions.
You will also need [git](https://git-scm.com) to work with the source code and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) to build it.

The recommended way to work with the source code is using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), a code editor, and the dev environment that can be found in the [trainlink-dev](https://github.com/trainlink-org/trainlink-dev) repository.
There you will find more information on how to set up local dev environment and get started.
